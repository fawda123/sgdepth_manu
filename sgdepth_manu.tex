\section{Introduction}

Issues related to excessive nutrient pollution have motivated a substantial amount of research to understand and address impacts on coastal waters.  Eutrophication, defined as an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem \citep{Nixon95}, is primarily caused by anthropegenic inputs of limiting nutrients that exceed background concentrations of receiving waters.  Adverse impacts on aquatic resources are well-documented and have included increased occurrence in the frequency and severity of harmfal algal blooms \citep{Cloern96}, reduction of dissolved oxygen necessary to support heterotrophic organisms \citep{Justic87,Diaz08}, and loss of ecosystem functioning through food web simplification \citep{Tewfik07}. Although management activities have been successful in mitigating or reversing eutrophication impacts (e.g., \citealt{Greening06}), the evaluation of response endpoints remains an important topic given that ecosystem changes in relation to different nutrient regimes are not fully understood nor anticipated \citep{Duarte09}.  The most appropriate indicators of ecosystem response may be those that exhibit clear biological linkages with water quality changes, such that the potential effects of management actions can be unambiguously characterized through known cause and effect pathways.  Critical management decisions may be forced by tentative assessments, political or societal pressures, or qualitative criteria in the absence of empirical methods to identify adequate indicators of ecosytem response \citep{Duarte09}.  

The ecosystem services provided by seagrasses as well as their sensitivity to water quality changes has contributed to their proliferation as biological response endpoints for eutrophication.  Seagrasses are ecosystem engineers \citep{Jones94,Koch01} that serve a structural and functional role in altering aquatic habitat often through different feedback mechanisms with other ecosystem components.  For example, seagrass beds create habitat for juvenile fish and crabs by reducing wave action and stabilizing sediment \citep{williams01,Hughes09}.  Seagrasses also respond to changes in water clarity through direct physiological linkages with light availability.  In short, increased nutrient loading contributes to reductions in water clarity through increased algal concentrations, inhibiting the growth of seagrass through light limitation \citep{Duarte95}.  Empirical relationships between nutrient loading, water clarity, light requirements, and the maximum depth of seagrass colonization have been identified \citep{Duarte91,Kenworthy96,Choice14}, such that quantitative standards have been developed to maintain light regimes sufficient for seagrass growth targets \citep{Steward05}.  Conversely, seagrass depth limits have formed the basis of quantititative criteria for nutrient load targets \citep{Janicki96}.  Contrasted with numeric standards for nutrients and phytoplankon, seagrass-based criteria may be more practical for developing water quality standards given that seagrasses are integrative of system-wide conditions over time and less variable with changes in nutrient regimes \citep{Duarte95}.  

The development of numeric criteria and standards for coastal waters has been a management priority within the United States \citep{USEPA98} and internationally \citep{WFD00}.  Numerous agencies and management programs have developed a variety of techniques for estimating seagrass depth limits as a basis for establishing numeric criteria, either as restoration targets or for identifying critical load limits.  Such efforts have been useful for site-specific approaches where the analysis needs are driven by a particular management or research context \citep[e.g.,][]{Iverson86,Hale04}. However, a lack of standardization among methods has prevented broad-scale comparisons between regions and has even contributed to discrepancies between measures of depth limits based on the chosen technique.  For example, seagrass depth limits based on in situ techniques can vary with the sampling device \citep{Spears09}.  Despite the availability of data, techniques for estimating seagrass depth of colonization using remotely sensed data have not been extensively developed.  Such techniques have the potential to facilitate broad-scale comparisons between regions given the spatial coverage and annual availability of many products.  For example, recent analyses by \citetalias{HagyIR} have shown that standardized techniques from seagrass coverage maps and bathymetric data can be used to compare growth patterns over time among different coastal regions of Florida.  Such methods show promise, although further development to improve the spatial resolution of the analysis are needed.  Specifically, methods for estimating seagrass depth limits should be reproducible for broad-scale comparisons, while also maintaining flexibility for site-specific estimates depending on management needs.

Reproducible and empirical approaches can be developed to provide more consistent estimates of seagrass depth limits for restoration targets or criteria development. We describe a method for estimating seagrass depth of colonization using information-rich datasets to create a spatially explicit and repeatable estimate.  In particular, methods described in \citetalias{HagyIR} are improved upon by creating a flexible and repeatable technique for estimating seagrass depth limits from coverage maps and bathymetric data. The specific objectives are to\begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item describe the method for estimating seagrass depth limits within a relevant spatial context, 
\item apply the technique to four distinct regions of Florida to illustrate improved clarity of description, and
\item develop a spatially coherent relationship between depth limits and water clarity for the case studies.  
\end{inparaenum}
Overall, these methods are expected to inform the development of water quality criteria based on empirical relationships of seagrass depth limits with water clarity over time.  The method is applied to data from Florida although the technique is transferable to other regions with comparable data. 

\section{Methods}

Development of a spatially-referenced approach to estimate seagrass \ac{doc} relied extensively on data and partially on methods described in \citetalias{HagyIR}.  The following is a summary of locations and data sources, methods and rationale for incorporating spatial information in seagrass \ac{doc} estimates, and evaluation of the approach including relationships with water clarity.   

\subsection{Locations and data sources}

Four unique locations were chosen for the analysis: Choctowatchee Bay (Panhandle), Big Bend region (northeast Gulf of Mexico), Tampa Bay (central Gulf Coast of Florida), and Indian River Lagoon (east coast) (\cref{tab:seg_summ,fig:seg_all}).  These locations represent different geographic regions in the state, in addition to readily available data and observed gradients in water clarity that likely contributed to hetereogeneity in seagrass growth patterns.  For example, the Big Bend region was chosen based on location near an outflow of the Steinhatchee River where higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter are observed.  Seagrasses near the outflow were observed to grow at shallower depths as compared to locations far from the river source.  Coastal regions and estuaries in Florida are divided into individual spatial units based on a segmentation scheme developed by US \ac{EPA} for the development of numeric nutrient criteria.  One segment from each geographic location was used for the analysis to evaluate estimates of seagrass \ac{doc}.  The segments included numbers 0303 (Choctowatchee Bay), 0820 (Big Bend region), 0902 (Tampa Bay), and 1502 (Indian River Lagoon), where the first two digits indicate the estuary and the last two digits indicate the segment within the estuary. 

Data used to estimate seagrass \ac{doc} were primarily obtained from publically available \ac{GIS} products.  At the most generic level, spatially-referenced information describing seagrass aerial coverage combined with co-located bathymetric depth information were used to estimate \ac{doc}.  These data products are available in coastal regions of Florida through the US Geological Survey, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and watershed management districts.  Data are generally more available in larger estuaries that are of specific management concern, e.g., Tampa Bay, Indian River Lagoon.  For example, seagrass coverage data are available from 1950 (Tampa Bay) to present day (multiple estuaries), with more recent products available at annual or  biennial intervals.  Seagrass coverage maps are less frequent in areas with lower population densities (e.g., Big Bend region) or where seagrass is naturally absent (northeast Florida).  Seagrass maps were produced using photo-interpretations of aerial images to categorize coverage as absent, discontinuous (patchy), or continuous.  For this analysis, we considered seagrass coverage as being only present (continuous and patchy) or absent since the former did not represent unequivocal categories between regions. 

Seagrass coverage maps were combined with bathymetric depth layers to characterize location and depth of growth in each location.  Bathymetric depth layers for each location were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (\acsu{NOAA}) National Geophysical Data Center as either \acp{DEM} or raw sounding data from hydroacoustic surveys.  Tampa Bay data provided by the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program are described in \citet{Tyler07}. Bathymetic data for the Indian River Lagoon were obtained from the St. John's Water Management District \citep{CPE97}.  \ac{NOAA} products were referenced to mean lower low water, whereas Tampa Bay data were referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 and the Indian River Lagoon data were referenced to mean sea level.  Depth layers were combined with seagrass coverage layers using standard union techniques of raster and vector layers in ArcMap 10.1 \citep{ESRI12}.  To reduce computation time, depth layers were first masked using a 1 km buffer of the seagrass coverage layer.  The final layer used for analysis was a point layer with attributes describing location (latitude, longitude, segment), depth (m), and seagrass (present, absent).  Additional details describing the data are available in \citetalias{HagyIR}.    

\subsection{Segment-based estimates of seagrass depth of colonization}

Methods in \citetalias{HagyIR} describe an approach for estimating seagrass \ac{doc} at individual coastal segments.  Seagrass depth data described above are used to estimate maximum ($Z_{cMax}$) and median ($Z_{c50\%}$) seagrass \ac{doc}, where the maximum depth is defined as the deepest depth at which a ``significant'' coverage of seagrasses occured in a segment and the median depth is defined as the median depth occurring at the deep water edge. The seagrass depth points are grouped into bins and the proportion of points within each depth bin that contain seagrass are quantified.  Both seagrass \ac{doc} estimates are obtained from a plot of proportion of points occupied at each depth bin.  In general, the plot is characterized by a decreasing trend such that the proportion of occupied points by depth bin decreases and eventually flattens with increasing depth.  A regression is fit on this descending portion of the curve such that the intercept point on the x-axis is considered the maximum depth of colonization.  The median portion of this curve is considered the median depth of the deepwater edge of seagrass.   

Considerable spatial heterogeneity in the observed seagrass growth patterns suggests that a segment-wide estimate of seagrass \ac{doc} may be inadequate for fully characterizing growth patterns, particularly for the examples in the current analysis. \Cref{fig:wbid_doc} illustrates spatial variation in seagrass distribution  for a location in the Big Bend region of Florida.  Using methods in \citetalias{HagyIR}, the estimate for median seagrass \ac{doc} for the segment is over- and under-estimated for different areas of the segment.  In particular, \ac{doc} is greatly over-estimated at the outflow of the Steinhatchee where high concentrations of dissolved organic matter naturally limit seagrass growth.  This example suggests that estimates of \ac{doc} may be needed at finer spatial scales to provide a more robust determination of restoration targets and nutrient criteria.

\subsection{Estimating seagrass depth of colonization using spatial information}

The approach used to estimate seagrass \ac{doc} with spatial information has several key differences with the original method.  As before, seagrass \ac{doc} estimates are based on empirical measures of the frequency occurrence of seagrass by increasing depth.  The first difference is that maximum \ac{doc} is estimated from a logistic growth curve fit through the data, in addition to a simple linear regression in the previous example.  Second, a third measure describing the depth at which seagrass were most commonly located was defined, in addition to median and maximum depth of growth.  The third and most important difference is that the estimates are assigned to discrete locations, using either a grid of points or as a single location of interest. Methods and implications of these differences are described below.                                   

The spatially-referenced approach for estimating \ac{doc} begins by creating a grid of evenly-spaced points within the segment.  The same process for estimating \ac{doc} is used for each point.  Alternatively, a single location of interest can be chosen rather than a grid-based design.  Seagrass depth data (i.e., merged bathymetric and seagrass coverage data) that occur within a set radius from the chosen locations are selected for estimating seagrass \ac{doc} values. The estimate for each location is quantified from a plot of the proportion of bathymetric soundings that contain seagrass at each depth bin (\cref{fig:est_ex1}).  Although the chosen radius for selecting depth points is problem-specific, the minimum radius must sample a sufficient number of points for estimating \ac{doc}.  In general, an appropriate radius will produce a plot that indicates a decrease in the proportion of points that are occupied by seagrass with increasing depth.  

A curve is fit to the sampled depth points using non-linear regression to characterize the reduction in seagrass as a function of depth.  Specifically, a decreasing logistic growth curve is fit to the plot to create a monotonic and asymptotic function of the sample data.   The curve is fit by minimizing the residual sums-of-squares with the Gauss-Newton algorithm \citep{Bates92} and user-supplied starting parameters that are an approximate estimate of the curve characteristics.  The model has the following form:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:prop}
 Proportion = \frac{\alpha}{1 + \mathrm{e}^{{\left(\beta - Depth\right)/\gamma}}}
\end{equation}
where the proportion of points occupied by seagrass at each depth is defined by a logistic curve with an asymptote $\alpha$, a midpoint inflection $\beta$, and a scale parameter $\gamma$.  Starting values $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ were estimated empirically from the observed data.  

Finally, a simple linear curve is fit through the inflection point ($\beta$) of the logistic curve to estimate depth of colonization (\cref{fig:est_ex3}).  The inflection point is the depth at which seagrass are decreasing at a maximum rate and is used as the slope of the linear curve.  Three measures describing seagrass growth characteristics are obtained. The maximum depth of seagrass colonization, $DOC_{max}$, is the x-axis intercept of the linear curve.  The minimum depth of seagrass growth, $DOC_{min}$ is the location where the linear curve intercepts the asymptote of the logistic growth curve.  This depth can be considered the start of the decline in seagrass coverage with increasing depth.  The median depth of seagrass colonization, $DOC_{med}$, is the depth halfway between $DOC_{min}$ and $DOC_{max}$.  $DOC_{med}$ was typically but not always the inflection point of the logistic growth curve.  Functionally, each measure has specific ecological significance.  The median and maximum depth estimates describe the growth limitations of seagrasses as a function of water clarity, whereas minimum depth of growth was often where the highest percentage of seagrass coverage was obesrved in the sample.  Median and maximum depth estimates differ in that the former describes the median depth of the deep water edge, whereas the latter describes a nominal characterization of maximum depth independent of outliers.

Estimates for each of the three \ac{doc} measures are obtained only if specific criteria are met.  These criteria were implemented as a safety measure that ensures a sufficient amount and appropriate quality of data are used.  First, estimates are provided only if a sufficient number of seagrass depth points are present within the radius of the grid point to estimate a logistic growth curve.  This criteria applies to the sample size as well as the number of points with seagrass in the sample.  That is, the curve cannot be estimated for small samples or if an insufficient number of points contain seagrass regardless of sample size.  Second, estimates are provided only if an inflection point is present on the logistic curve within the range of the sampled depth data.  This criteria may apply under two scenarios where the curve is estimated but a trend is not adequately described by the sampled data.  That is, a curve may be estimated that describes only the initial decrease in points occupied as a function of depth but the observed points do not occur at depths deeper than the predicted inflection point.  The opposite scenario may occur when a curve is estimated but only the deeper locations beyond the inflection point are present in the sample.  Finally, the estimate for $DOC_{min}$ is set to zero depth if the linear curve through the inflection point intercepts the asympote at x-axis values less than zero.  The estimate for $DOC_{med}$ is also shifted to the depth value halfway between $DOC_{min}$ and $DOC_{max}$.  

All estimates were obtained using custom-made functions in program R that were based on the \texttt{nls} and \texttt{SSlogis} functions to fit a nonlinear least squares using a self-starting logistic growth model \citep{Bates92,RDCT14}.  All seagrass depth shapefiles were imported and processed in R using functions in the \texttt{rgeos} and \texttt{sp} packages \citep{Bivand08,Bivand14}.  

\subsection{Comparison with segment-based approach and sensitivity analysis}

Spatially-referenced estimates for seagrass \ac{doc} were obtained for each of the four segments described above.  Segment-wide estimates obtained using methods in \citetalias{HagyIR} were used as a basis of comparison such that departures from these values were evidence of spatial heterogeneity in seagrass growth patterns within each segment.  A sampling grid of locations for estimating each of the three depth values in \cref{fig:est_ex} was created for each segment.  The grid is masked by the segment boundaries to remove locations that did not occur on the water, whereas seagrass depth points used to estimate \ac{doc} extended beyond the segment  boundaries.  Initial spacing between sample points was chosen arbitrarily as 0.02 decimal degrees, which is approximately 2 km at 30 degrees N latitude.  The sampling radius around each sampling location in the grid was also chosen as 0.02 decimal degrees to allow for complete coverage of seagrass within the segment while also minimizing redundancy of information described by each location.  In other words, radii were set such that the seagrass depth points sampled by each grid location were only partially overlapped by those sampled by neighboring points.

The ability to characterize heterogeneity in seagrass growth patterns using the grid-based approach can be informed by evaluating the level of confidence associated with \ac{doc} estimates.  Confidence intervals for non-linear regression can be estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach that considers the variance and covariance between the model parameters and the depth measurements \citep{Hilborn97}.  For simplicity, we assume that the observation uncertainty associated with the depth measurements is zero such that the variability associated with parameter estimates is considered the primary source of uncertainty.  A 95\% confidence interval for each \ac{doc} estimates was constructed by repeated sampling of a multivariate normal distribution followed by prediction of the proportion of points occupied by seagrass as in \cref{eqn:prop}.  The sampling distribution assumes:
\begin{equation}
x \sim N(\mu, \Sigma)
\end{equation}
\noindent where $x$ is a predictor variable used in \cref{eqn:prop} that follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\mu$, and variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$.  The mean values are set at the depth value corresponding to the inflection point on the logistic curve and the predicted model parameters (i.e., $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$), whereas $\Sigma$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the model parameters and depth, with the latter being zero.  A large number of samples ($n = 10000$) were drawn from the distrubution to characterize the uncertainty.  The 2.5\textsuperscript{th} and 97.5\textsuperscript{th} quantile values of the sample were considered bounds on the 95\% confidence interval.

The uncertainty associated with the \ac{doc} estimates were based on the upper and lower limits of the estimated inflection point on the logistic growth curve.  This approach was used because uncertainty in the inflection point is directly related to uncertainty in each of the \ac{doc} estimates that are based on the linear curve fit through the inflection point.   Specifically, linear curves were fit through the upper and lower estimates of the inflection point to identify upper and lower limits for the estimates of $DOC_{min}$, $DOC_{med}$, and $DOC_{max}$.  These values were compared with the initial estimates from the linear curve that was fit through the predicted logistic curve (i.e., \cref{fig:est_ex3}).  This approach provided an indication of uncertainty for individual estimates for a set radius.  Uncertainty estimates were obtained for each \ac{doc} estimate for the grids in each segment.

\subsection{Developing a spatially coherent relationship of water clarity with depth of colonization}

Potentially useful information describing seagrass light requirements can be obtained from the maximum depth estimates by evaluating spatial relationships with water clarity.  In particular, increased resolution of seagrass depth estimates compared with multiple measures of water clarity can potentially improve the ability to empirically describe light requirements leading to the development of numeric criteria. Secchi measurements provide a precise estimate of water clarity and have been obtained at numerous locations documented in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Impaired \ac{IWR} database. All available secchi data for each of the four segments were obtained from the \ac{IWR} database, update number 40.  Prior to analysis, all secchi data were screened to exclude observations that were flagged indicating that the value was lower than the maximum depth of the observation point.  Secchi data were also compared with bathymetric data to verify unflagged values were not missed by initial screening.

The relationship between seagrass depth limits and secchi measurements were explored using previously established light requirements and attenuation equations.  The traditional Lambert-Beer equation describes the exponential decrease of light availability with depth:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:lambeer}
I_{z} = I_{O} \cdot \exp\left(-K_{d} \cdot Z\right)
\end{equation}
\noindent such that the irradiance of incident light at depth $Z$ ($I_{Z}$) can be estimated from the irradiance at the surface ($I_{O}$) and a light extinction coefficient ($K_{d}$). Minimum seagrass light requirements have also been estimated numerous times.  For example, \citet{Duarte91} indicate that minimum light requirements for seagrass are on average 11\% of surface irradiance. Others have shown that light requirements are species dependent and variable by latitude witgh estimates ranging from less than 5\% to greater than 30\% \citep{Dennison93}.  Estimated light requirements (e.g., 20\%) can be used with \cref{eqn:lambeer} to describe $DOC_{max}$:
\begin{equation}
0.20 = \exp\left(-K_{d} \cdot DOC_{max}\right)
\end{equation}
A conversion factor is often used to estimate the light extinction coefficient from secchi depth $Z_{d}$, such that such that $c = K_{d} \cdot Z_{d}$, where $c$ has been estimated as 1.7 \citep{Poole29,Idso74}.  Thus, $K_{d}$ can be replaced with the conversion factor and the equation is rearranged to describe $DOC_{max}$ as a function of secchi depth $Z_{d}$:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:sgreg}
DOC_{max} = \frac{-\log\left(0.20\right)}{1.7} \cdot Z_{d}
\end{equation}
\noindent A regression of seagrass depth estimates against secchi measurements is expected to have a slope corresponding to the constant in \cref{eqn:sgreg}.  The geographic coordinates for each secchi measurement were used as locations for estimating $DOC_{max}$ in each segment.  These estimates were compared with the secchi estimates using linear regression forced through the origin.  However, the relationship is expected to vary depending on the specific radius around each sample point for estimating $DOC_{max}$.  An appropriate radius was chosen that minimized the difference between the empirically estimated slope and that in \cref{eqn:sgreg}.  Scatter in the regression through these points can be considered biologically meaningful, such that points below the curve are locations where seagrasses are observed at maximum depth with less irradiance than expected given \cref{eqn:sgreg}, whereas points above the curve are those where seagrasses are growing deeper than expected. The estimated light requirements of each point can be plotted using the cartesian coordinates to evaluate spatial variation in seagrass growth as a function of light-limitation.

Acknowledge that comparisons with segment wide estimate are specific to grid spacing and radii tha twere used, thus the comparison is only useful for illustrating the presence of heterogeneity within segments, as well as variation between segments.  Absolute values will vary with different spacing and radii.

Map locations are georeferenced observations of water clarity from secchi measurements in the Florida \acl{IWR} database, update 40.  Data are also summarized by bay segment as boxplots where the dimensions are the 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile, median, and 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile.  Whiskers extend beyond the boxes as 1.5 multiplied by the interquartile range.  Light requirements are based on daily average secchi values for each location using all observations for Tampa Bay, estimated maximum depth of colonization using a radius of 0.7 decimal degrees for each secchi location to sample seagrass depth points for 2010 coverage data, and empirical relationships described by \cref{eqn:lambeer}.
