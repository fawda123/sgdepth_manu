.doc files (not .docx) are accepted as submission

Here are the steps to converting my pdf to a word docuemnt

- process as sweave to pdf in RStudio as always

- use pandoc from the command line to create a bibliography using a cls zotero file, note that the estuaries and coasts file from zotera wouldn't work with the manuscript

	M:\docs\manuscripts\sgdepth_manu>pandoc --bibliography=refs.bib --csl=apa.csl -o out.doc sgdepth_manu.tex

- this creates a word document with a bibliography in a kind of correct format

- acronyms and aliased citations are removed from the word document, these have to be added manually

- edit as needed - all equations edited by hand
