They do no accept latex but do accept pdf for initial submissions

The revised version will ultimately have to be a word file

Here are the steps to creating the initial submissions:

- process as sweave to pdf in RStudio as always

- use pandoc from the command line to create a bibliography using a cls zotero file

	C:\Users\mbeck\Desktop\test>pandoc --bibliography=ref_diss.bib --csl=limnology-and-	oceanography.csl -o out.docx swmp_noise.tex

- this creates a word document with a bibliography in the correct format

- note that aliased citations will not be included, will have to add manually

- remove the references (edit blocks) in the original pdf

- add text boxes and paste the bibliography from the word document

After revisions are made - pdf to word doc, then edit by hand
